# Projeto de PSI

This was a hotel website, complete with a booking system, developed as part of Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa's Project of Systems of Information course.

It used Angular in the front ends, and Node.js express and MongoDB in the backend. Sadly, because it's been a while since we've worked on it, and we don't have the resources we did at university, we lack the resources and know-how on how to run it.
